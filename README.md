# IntegrationTool

The Integration Tool allows to run and organize workflows, in which you can execute several tasks and import/migrate data from different sources to different targets.

## How can I contribute?

You are very welcome to contribute. I list ideas I'd like to see in the Integration Tool in the Wiki. If you want to implement on of them:

- Please open an issue with the label "requirement takeover". I'll then list you as the contributor behind that idea! We will use this issue as well to discuss everything around it (the idea). 
- In the issue please estimate how long it will take you to implement it.
- Next, please create a fork and whenever your code is ready, you create a pull request.
